# Heafoody

Food delivery system:
My colleagues and I will make a food delivery system program and it is called heafoody, it will have 3 different restaurants and a person could chose a restaurant then order what he want’s from it, and then displays his order with the total price and delivery fees.

Method(dispRest): this method will display the available restaurant and the option to chose from.

Method(dispMenu): this method will display the restaurant menu and the option to chose from.

Method(total): this method will give the total amount of the buyer order plus a delivery fee.
